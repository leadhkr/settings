## Git Open Script
git-open allows you to open your remote git repo from the command line. 
To install, download the scripts/git-open file and save to your path (e.g., /usr/local/bin). Then, run the following command to make it an executable git command: 

```chmod +x /usr/bin/local/git-open```

Now you can run the `git open` command in your terminal when your current directory is version controlled and has a git remote set.
